# Design-Patterns
All Design Patterns code and explanation are here, explanation will be inside each folder of specific Design Pattern and the code will be written in C# at environment Visual Studio Code.

Trying to make the code simple as I can with good explanation, read inside the folder the explanation of the design pattern, clone the design pattern to your environment and run it to see the results and understand it even deeply.

#Adapter

In computer programming, the adapter pattern (often referred to as the wrapper pattern or simply a wrapper) is a design pattern that translates 
one interface for a class into a compatible interface. An adapter allows classes to work together that normally could not because of incompatible 
interfaces, by providing its interface to clients while using the original interface. The adapter translates calls to its interface into calls to the original 
interface, and the amount of code necessary to do this is typically small. The adapter is also responsible for transforming data into appropriate forms.
 For instance, if multiple boolean values are stored as a single integer but your consumer requires a 'true'/'false', the adapter would be responsible for 
extracting the appropriate values from the integer value.

It allows two unrelated interfaces to work together through the different objects, possibly playing same role.
It modifies original interface.
