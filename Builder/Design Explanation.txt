The key difference between a builder and factory IMHO, is that a builder is useful when you need to do lots of things to build an object. 
For example imagine a DOM. You have to create plenty of nodes and attributes to get your final object. 
A factory is used when the factory can easily create the entire object within one method call.

One example of using a builder is a building an XML document, I've used this model when building HTML fragments for example I might have a 
Builder for building a specific type of table and it might have the following methods (parameters are not shown):

BuildOrderHeaderRow()
BuildLineItemSubHeaderRow()
BuildOrderRow()
BuildLineItemSubRow()
